### 🚀 About Me

I'm a **Software Developer/Engineer** passionate about building robust and efficient applications. My foundation is in software engineering, but I'm driven by a curiosity for the technologies that will shape our future. This has led me to explore two fascinating domains:

-   🛡️ **Cybersecurity:** I have a strong interest in building secure software and understanding the landscape of digital threats. I enjoy learning about ethical hacking, penetration testing, and defensive strategies to protect systems and data.
-   🌌 **Quantum Computing:** I am just beginning my journey into the world of quantum mechanics. I'm currently focused on grasping the fundamental concepts like qubits, superposition, and entanglement, and I'm learning to build my first quantum circuits using **IBM's Qiskit**.
